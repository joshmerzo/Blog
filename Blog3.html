                    Hello! I’m Josh Gerald C. Merzo, a 21-year-old Information Systems student at the Technological University of the Philippines-Manila. I want to share the journey that sparked my passion for technology and the thrill of solving problems through programming.

                <h2 class="mt-4">How It All Began</h2>
                <p>
                    It all started during my first year in college when I was introduced to programming. Although I found it challenging at first, something clicked as I worked through my first project. I enjoyed the logic, the structure, and the creativity that coding brought. Since then, I’ve been on an exciting journey, learning various programming languages and expanding my technical skills.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over the past few years, I’ve developed a working knowledge of several programming languages, including C, C++, and Java. Each language has its quirks and strengths, and diving into them has been like learning new dialects of a shared language. My current focus is on improving my proficiency in Java, Databases and exploring web development fundamentals.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Looking ahead, I’m excited to continue building my skills and exploring the latest technology trends. My goal is to become a skilled software developer who can create meaningful, impactful solutions. I’m particularly interested in areas like software engineering, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Thanks for reading, and I hope you’ll follow along as I continue to document my experiences and growth in this field!
