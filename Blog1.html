                    Hello! I’m Josh Gerald C. Merzo, a 21-year-old Information Systems student at the Technological University of the Philippines-Manila. I want to share the journey that sparked my passion for technology and the thrill of solving problems through programming.

                        I’m a naturally optimistic and cheerful person who enjoys adding a bit of humor to others’ days. Laughter and positivity are such a big part of who I am, and I think it brings warmth to the people around me.
                    </p>

                        <p>
                            One of my absolute favorite ways to relax is spending time with my pet Truffles—a Shihtzu/Jack Russel-Cocker Spaniel mix who’s been with me since I received her as a graduation gift. She’s 3 years old now, and her lively personality never fails to bring a smile to my face. Whether we’re playing fetch or just hanging out, she’s always there, and I can’t imagine life without her.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                
                    <p>
                        Another favorite pastime of mine is gaming—specifically playing online games with friends. There’s something about the game that really pulls me in, and sharing that excitement with others makes it even better. The thrill of strategizing and competing as a team adds a unique rush, and it’s become a great way for me to connect with friends, even when we’re all in different places.
                    </p>

                        <p>
                            One hobby I’d love to revisit is volleyball. I played a lot back in high school, and I truly miss being on the court. Volleyball was more than just a sport; it was an amazing way to stay active, build teamwork, and enjoy some friendly competition. Unfortunately, with the demands of college, I haven’t found the time to get back into it, but I definitely hope to pick it up again soon.
